# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a functional online study tool for new Bootcamp students. It can also function as a permanent, on-hand reference for them as they progress throughout the course. Through the creation of this application I was able to learn about Javascript, Git, CSS, HTML, and much more that goes into coding even a simple web page!

## Usage

The sections of this site contain useful information about the disciplines that were covered in Prework. Opening the console, via right click -> Inspect on google chrome, will show the javascript functions working as intended, allowing the student to randomly decide which topic to study.
